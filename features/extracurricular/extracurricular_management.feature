Feature: Extracurricular management
    As an admin
    I need to manage extracurricular activities catalogue
    In order to enroll students and control interaction with other services

    Scenario: New activity is added to empty catalogue
        Given There is a new extracurricular activity 'Robotics' that will run on 'morning' of 'monday, wednesday'
        When It is added to the catalogue
        Then Catalogue should have '1' activity

    Scenario: New activity has several groups
        Given There is a new extracurricular activity 'Arts' that have groups
            | group | time | schedule |
            | EP | morning | monday, friday |
            | ESO | afternoon | monday, friday |
        When It is added to the catalogue
        Then Catalogue should have '2' activities

    Scenario: Student enrolls to one activity
        Given There is a Student Called 'Pedro DÃ­az'
        And There is an activity in the catalogue called 'Robotics'
        When Student enrolls to activity 'Robotics'
        Then Activity 'Robotics' should be appended to Student's list of activities
